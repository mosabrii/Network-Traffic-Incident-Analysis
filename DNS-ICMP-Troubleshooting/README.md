# DNS & Network Connectivity Incident Analysis

## Overview
This lab simulates a real-world network connectivity incident where users are unable to access a website due to a network-layer communication failure. The scenario focuses on analyzing network traffic data and error messages to identify the affected service and understand the root cause of the issue.

## Scenario
Multiple users reported that they could not access the website `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` and received a *destination port unreachable* error.

Initial investigation shows that network requests sent from client devices result in network error responses, preventing the website from loading.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with reviewing network traffic logs to determine what went wrong and which network service was impacted.

## Objectives
- Analyze network traffic related to a service outage  
- Identify affected network services and protocols  
- Interpret error messages observed in network logs  
- Understand the impact of network-layer issues on business services  
- Practice documenting incident analysis in a structured way  

## What This Lab Covers
- Network-layer troubleshooting  
- Service disruption analysis  
- Error interpretation in network traffic  
- Incident analysis mindset used in SOC and Blue Team roles  

## Deliverables
This lab includes:
- An incident analysis report documenting findings and conclusions  
- Supporting network traffic evidence (logs)  

## Notes
This lab is designed for educational and skill-development purposes and reflects scenarios commonly encountered by cybersecurity and SOC analysts.
