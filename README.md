# Network Traffic Incident Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity labs focused on analyzing network traffic during security incidents.
The projects simulate real-world SOC scenarios involving abnormal traffic patterns, service disruptions, and malicious activity at the network layer.

Each lab represents a standalone incident investigation, emphasizing analytical thinking, evidence-based conclusions, and structured reporting rather than tool dependency.

## Objectives
- Analyze network traffic captured during security incidents
- Identify abnormal patterns, attack indicators, and affected services
- Understand root causes and potential attacker techniques
- Practice SOC-style incident analysis and documentation

## Incident Scenarios Covered
The repository includes multiple realistic incident cases, such as:
- DNS and ICMP communication failures
- TCP SYN flood and denial-of-service patterns
- Web brute-force attempts and abnormal HTTP behavior
- Network-level risks arising from user behavior and social platforms

## Methodology
Each incident analysis follows a structured investigation approach:
- Initial symptom identification
- Traffic inspection and log review
- Indicator extraction and attack pattern recognition
- Impact assessment and root cause analysis
- Documented findings and conclusions

The analysis aligns with SOC workflows and incident response best practices.

## Lab Structure
- Each folder represents an independent incident case
- Labs are organized in a logical, numbered sequence
- Every case includes documentation outlining:
  - Incident context
  - Observations and findings
  - Analysis conclusions

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network Traffic Analysis
- Incident Investigation & Root Cause Analysis
- SOC Analytical Thinking
- Log Review and Pattern Recognition
- Security Documentation and Reporting

## Intended Audience
This repository is designed for:
- SOC Analysts (L1/L2)
- Cybersecurity students and interns
- Anyone developing incident analysis and blue/purple team skills

## Disclaimer
- All scenarios are fictional and created for educational purposes
- No real systems, organizations, or individuals are involved
- Any resemblance to real incidents is coincidental
