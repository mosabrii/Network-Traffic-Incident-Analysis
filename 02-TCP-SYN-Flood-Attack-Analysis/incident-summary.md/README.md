## Incident Summary

The company’s website experienced a service outage after an unusually high volume of incoming connection requests was detected within a short period of time. As a result, the web server became overwhelmed and was unable to process legitimate user requests, leading to connection timeout errors.

The issue was initially identified through the organization’s automated monitoring system, which alerted the security team to abnormal network traffic patterns targeting the web server.

Due to this incident, the company’s website became unavailable, preventing employees and users from accessing the sales webpage and disrupting normal business operations.

Initial findings indicate that the outage was caused by a suspected network-based denial-of-service (DoS) attack, designed to flood the server with excessive connection requests and exhaust system resources, ultimately impacting service availability.
