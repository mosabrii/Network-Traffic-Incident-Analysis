# Network Traffic Incident Analysis

This repository contains practical cybersecurity labs focused on analyzing network traffic during security incidents.

The labs simulate real-world scenarios that a SOC or Cybersecurity Analyst may encounter, such as network service disruptions, communication failures, and abnormal traffic behavior.

Each folder represents a standalone incident analysis case, including investigation steps, findings, and conclusions based on network data and logs.

## Objectives
- Analyze network traffic during security incidents
- Identify affected network services and communication issues
- Understand incident symptoms, root causes, and impacts
- Practice structured incident reporting and documentation

## Lab Structure
- Each lab is organized in a numbered folder
- Every lab includes documentation and analysis results
- Labs are independent and can be reviewed separately

This repository is intended for educational and skill-development purposes.
