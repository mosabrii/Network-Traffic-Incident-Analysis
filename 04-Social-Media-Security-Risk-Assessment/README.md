# Social Media Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project documents a security risk assessment for a social media organization that recently experienced a data breach exposing sensitive user information. The assessment focuses on identifying key security weaknesses and recommending network hardening measures to reduce future risks.

---

## Scenario Summary
A security review revealed several critical vulnerabilities within the organization’s network environment:

- Employees were sharing passwords.
- The database administrator account was using a default password.
- Firewall rules were not configured to filter network traffic.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was not implemented.

These weaknesses significantly increased the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

---

## Objectives
- Identify major network and access control vulnerabilities.
- Assess the risks associated with weak authentication and poor network controls.
- Recommend practical security hardening techniques.
- Demonstrate a real-world security risk assessment approach.

---

## Focus Areas
- Password and account management
- Administrative access security
- Network traffic filtering
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## Outcome
The assessment highlights critical security gaps and provides actionable recommendations to strengthen the organization’s network security posture and reduce the likelihood of future incidents.
